/// The api consists of four functions:
/// - init(void* base, size_t offset): init() receives a previously mmap'd region of memory 
///   and its maximum size.  It finds the allocator within that region, initializes this 
///   PersistentArenaManager from that allocator, and prepares to serve future allocation
///   and free requests.
/// - destroy(): currently a no-op, but part of the API in case we ever decide that init() 
///   should be responsible for calling mmap... in that case, destroy() would call munmap()
/// - get_mem(size_t): rounds the given size up to the next size class, finds (or creates)
///   an arena that has a free block of that size, and reserves / returns that block
/// - return_mem(void*): Determines the arena from which the provided pointer was allocated,
///   and returns that pointer to the arena.
